This is an ML model illustration for pioritization of COVID vaccine distribution in the districts of India based on several factors like Social Vulnerability Index, Health Vulnerability Index, Active, Confirmed total and death cases. We have made use of Hierarchical clustering and Actor CRITIC method in order to club districts under one cluster and then rank them respectively.
Problem Statement:

Owing to the limited vaccine availability and the dilapidated healthcare facilities within the subcontinent, the very problem of selective vaccine distribution arises. We intend to solve this problem of selective vaccine distribution as per the district’s vulnerability to the situation, which itself depends on factors as the population density of the region, immunity index, Health Vulnerability Index, Socio Economic Vulnerability Index, Social Vulnerability, environmental conditions and the comorbidity index of the region.DEA analysis for HVI and SVI calculation in order to foolproof the data consistency and correlation is one of the most important features that has been employed. The ranking algorithm using the Critic Method end justifies the HVI, SVI relation to the vulnerability of the district, and so specific priority score has been given to the districts making it user friendly output to understand the immediate need for vaccination. More the priority score, highly vulnerable is the district and thus gets clustered as per the Hierarchical clustering method with its equivalent priority score districts.
